'''**4.4.1 - Estimating PI**

Use the [Gaussâ€“Legendre_algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Legendre_algorithm) to estimate the value of PI. 
The program should generally follow the steps in the Wikipedia article.

Step 1: Declare/set the initial values for a0, b0, t0, and p0

Step 2: Loop and re-calculate those variables for 10 iterations

Step 3: Once the loop is completed, save the result to variable "pi_estimate" '''


# a variable to hold your returned estimate for PI. When you are done,
# set your estimated value to this variable. Do not change this variable name
pi_estimate = 0

Step 1: Declare and initialize all the values for the Gauss-Legendre algorithm

b = 1/math.sqrt(2)
